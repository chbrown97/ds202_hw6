```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

df <- read_excel('C:/Users/brown/ds202_hw6/BestInShow.xlsx', sheet='Best in show full sheet')

#Select the needed columns from the original data set
filtered <- df[,c("Best in show?", "largest value", "160", "X__6", "X__14", "X__24")]

#Continue cleaning the data by removing the first three rows (they contain useless info)
clean <- filtered[-c(1:3),]

#Continue cleaning by assigning better column names
colnames(clean) <- c("Breed", "Category", "Popularity", "Intelligence", "Score", "Height")

clean %>% ggplot(aes(x=Score, y=Popularity, color=Category)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Best in Show")

# Did not finish
# Next, I would have averaged the Intelligence and turned it into a factor with two levels. Then, I would have averaged the height and turned the variable into a factor with three levels. I would set shape=Intelligence and size=Height and include it in the ggplot. Lastly, I would add labels to all the points for the breed.
